        <div class="Two1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Falcon, originally designated YT 492727ZED and formerly known as the Stellar Envoy, was a Corellian 
            YT-1300f light freighter most famously used by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca, during and following the Galactic Civil War.
            During the Falcon's time in the possession of the smuggler Lando Calrissian, it accumulated numerous modifications in the name of 
            convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large escape pod. However, during Han Solo's infamous record-breaking 
            Kessel Run, in which he piloted the freighter for the first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered 
            by the time Solo won it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of sabacc. Its aged appearance still belied numerous advanced modifications 
            to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and shields, including a hyperdrive engine among the fastest in the entire galaxy, enabling it to outrun 
            Imperial Star Destroyers. It also included sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the rescue of Princess Leia Organa in 
            0 BBY (before Battle of Yavin) to evade Imperial stormtroopers. Afterwards, the Millennium Falcon saw further action when Solo chose to join the Rebel Alliance during 
            the Battle of Yavin, where it was able to sneak up and fire on Darth Vader's TIE Advanced, allowing Luke Skywalker to fire the proton torpedo 
            that set off the chain reaction causing the destruction of the Death Star.</div>
        <div class="Three1">After Solo was captured on Bespin, Calrissian took command of the Falcon once more to search for him. In 4 ABY
            (after the Battle of Yavin), following Solo's rescue, Calrissian flew the ship at the Battle of Endor, where it entered the DS-2 
            Death Star II Mobile Battle Station and aided in its destruction from within. Over the next decades, the ship fell out of Solo's 
            hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the ownership of the trader Unkar Plutt on Jakku, a 
            remote world in the Western Reaches. The Falcon was eventually stolen by the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey in 34 ABY. Shortly thereafter, 
            it was reunited with Solo and Chewbacca. Following Solo's death soon after, the Millennium Falcon became a Resistance vessel piloted 
            by its new owner, Rey, throughout much of the First Order/Resistance War. In 35 ABY, the ship was once again captained by Calrissian 
            during the Battle of Exegol, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance, before being returned to Rey, who had been 
            newly dubbed a Skywalker.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Falcon was a YT-1300f light freighter and its basic shape was defined by two 
            convex saucers welded together, a pair of front-facing mandibles and an outrigger-style, side-mounted cockpit with transparisteel viewports. 
            Because its successive owners either upgraded or downgraded every system according to their personal specifications, the freighter ended 
            up becoming a</div>

        <div class="Six1">unique ship. These customizations, however, came at the price 
            of reliability, and the Falcon was known to suffer frequent breakdowns in the heat of battle. After the circular military-grade sensor dish was lost during 
            the Battle of Endor, the dish was replaced with the base rectangular model which was originally supplied with the ship. During the Battle of Crait the Falcon 
            again lost its rectenna, and it was replaced with a military-grade rectenna similar to that of the one lost during the Battle of Endor.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Falcon's Girodyne SRB42 sublight engines were heavily modified through the addition of a SLAM overdrive that rerouted energy for acceleration bursts. 
            As a result, the ship could fly at a maximum speed of 1,200 kilometer per hour in atmosphere and 3,000 G in space. The stock hyperdrive of the YT-1300 series was 
            replaced with a Isu-Sim SSP05. Although the regular SSP05 was a Class 1 hyperdrive, the one that equipped the Falcon had been jury-rigged "Vandangante style" into 
            a Class 0.5 driveâ€”twice as fast as most warships of the Galactic Empire. The Falcon's hyperdrive failed 1.22 times more 
            than the one on the YT-2400 light freighter. In addition to its renowned hyperdrive, which supposedly made the Falcon the "fastest ship in the galaxy," the ship 
            was equipped with a backup hyperdrive. It was much slower than the primary engine and often took several weeks or months to reach the nearest star system.</div>
