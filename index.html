      <div class="words"><h1><a class="falconlink" href="index1.html"><span>Hyperdrive</span></a> vs.
      <a class="enterpriselink" href="index2.html"><span>Warp Drive</span></a>:</h1>
      <p>So what is the difference between a hyperdrive and a warp drive?<br>  
      <br><span class="answer">Answer:</span>  You can't even really compare the two. 
      A Hyperdrive allows you to travel around the galaxy in a matter of days whereas transit by warp drive takes decades, requiring 
      numerous refueling operations along the way. However, the disparity between the two technologies stems more from the 
      style of the two franchises than anything else: Star Wars is an action saga, and people needed to get places fast. The 
      Millennium Falcon still manages to fly from Hoth to Bespin in the Empire Strikes Back even without its hyperdrive. 
      Star Trek on the other hand, is a cerebral, slow, nerdy, and mostly serious franchise where the believe-ability of the 
      technology and science is an important part of the show. The warp drive is limited because it actually could exist under 
      our current understanding of physics. So while hyperdrives in star wars are infinitely more powrfull than warp drives in 
      star trek, the comparison is a essentially a nonsensical one.<br> 
      <br><a class="falconlink" href="index1.html"><span>Hyperdrive:</span></a>  Usually involves the ship “dropping” into subspace, or some dimensional variation wherein the distance between 
      stars is greatly reduced and speed is increased, although the ship never actually travels faster than the speed of light, persay. 
      Note: this is not wormhole travel, that is a different phenomena entirely. Within the dimension of hyperspace the laws of physics 
      are different, so ships can move over a greater distance with seemingly more speed, often by shortening the actual distance itself, then 
      exiting back to the corresponding place in real time/space upon arrival.<br>
      <br><a class="enterpriselink" href="index2.html"><span>Warp Drive:</span></a>  This type of drive physically warps space/time in such a fashion as to produce propulsion 
      that moves the ship at translight speeds relative to the universe at large. A warp drive literally bends space around a ship 
      to allow it to effectively cross distances faster.
